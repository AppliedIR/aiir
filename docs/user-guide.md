# User Guide

Valhuntir turns a single analyst into the manager of an agentic AI incident response team. This guide covers the full investigation workflow — from case creation through evidence analysis to final reporting.

> **Important Note** — While extensively tested, this is a new platform.
> ALWAYS verify results and guide the investigative process. If you just
> tell Valhuntir to "Find Evil" it will more than likely hallucinate
> rather than provide meaningful results. The AI can accelerate, but the
> human must guide it and review all decisions.

## Investigation Workflow

The recommended workflow uses OpenSearch for evidence indexing. Without OpenSearch, the same tools are available through direct file-based analysis — OpenSearch adds scale and structured querying at decreased token cost and greater speed, not capability.

```
1. Create a case             → case_init() or vhir case init
2. Register evidence         → evidence_register() or vhir evidence register
3. Ingest and index          → idx_ingest() to parse evidence into OpenSearch
4. Scope the investigation   → idx_case_summary() for hosts, artifacts, time ranges
5. Check for detections      → idx_list_detections() for Hayabusa/Sigma alerts
6. Enrich programmatically   → idx_enrich_triage() + idx_enrich_intel()
7. Search and analyze        → idx_search(), idx_aggregate(), idx_timeline()
8. Deep analysis             → run_command() with SIFT tools, run_windows_command()
9. Cross-reference           → search_knowledge(), check_file(), lookup_ioc()
10. Record findings          → record_finding() with evidence artifacts
11. Human review             → Examiner Portal or vhir approve
12. Generate report          → generate_report() with Zeltser guidance
```

Without OpenSearch, steps 3-7 are replaced by direct tool execution (`run_command`) and manual analysis. Steps 8-12 are identical either way.

## Case Management

### Creating a Case

From the CLI:

```bash
vhir case init "Suspicious Activity Investigation"
vhir case init "Ransomware Response" --description "Finance server, Feb 2026"
```

Or ask the LLM to create a case — it uses the `case_init` tool on case-mcp.

Both paths create a case directory under `~/.vhir/cases/` with a unique ID (e.g., `INC-2026-0225`) and activate it for the session.

**Claude Code users:** Launch Claude Code from the case directory so forensic controls and the sandbox apply. Other MCP clients connect to the gateway over HTTP and don't need to be launched from any specific directory — the active case is resolved from `~/.vhir/active_case`.

### Managing Multiple Cases

```bash
vhir case list                    # List all cases with status
vhir case activate INC-2026-0225  # Switch active case
vhir case status                  # Current case details
vhir case close INC-2026-0225 --summary "Investigation complete"
vhir case reopen INC-2026-0225    # Reopen if needed
```

The LLM can also list, activate, and check case status through case-mcp. The CLI is not required for basic case management.

### Case Directory Structure

Each case uses a flat directory layout with structured JSON files:

```
cases/INC-2026-0225/
├── CASE.yaml                    # Case metadata (name, status, examiner)
├── evidence/                    # Original evidence (lock with vhir evidence lock)
├── extractions/                 # Extracted artifacts and tool output
├── reports/                     # Generated reports
├── findings.json                # F-alice-001, F-alice-002, ...
├── timeline.json                # T-alice-001, ...
├── todos.json                   # TODO-alice-001, ...
├── iocs.json                    # IOC-alice-001, ... (auto-extracted from findings)
├── evidence.json                # Evidence registry with SHA-256 hashes
├── actions.jsonl                # Investigative actions (append-only)
├── evidence_access.jsonl        # Chain-of-custody log
├── approvals.jsonl              # Approval audit trail
├── pending-reviews.json         # Portal edits awaiting commit
└── audit/
    ├── forensic-mcp.jsonl       # Per-backend MCP audit logs
    ├── sift-mcp.jsonl
    ├── case-mcp.jsonl
    ├── claude-code.jsonl        # PostToolUse hook (Claude Code only)
    └── ...
```

### Evidence Registration

Register evidence files before analysis to establish chain of custody. Registration computes a SHA-256 hash and records it in `evidence.json`. Evidence must be registered before findings can reference it.

```bash
vhir evidence register /path/to/disk.E01 --description "Workstation image"
vhir evidence register /path/to/memory.raw --description "Memory dump from DC01"
```

Or ask the LLM to register evidence for you — it uses the `evidence_register` tool on case-mcp.

Verify integrity and manage access at any time:

```bash
vhir evidence verify              # Re-hash all registered evidence
vhir evidence lock                # Set evidence directory to read-only
vhir evidence unlock              # Restore write access for re-extraction
```

The LLM can register and verify evidence through case-mcp. Evidence lock/unlock requires the CLI (terminal confirmation).

### Case Backup

Back up case data (metadata, findings, timeline, audit trails) for archival or disaster recovery:

```bash
vhir backup /path/to/destination                     # Case data only (interactive)
vhir backup /path/to/destination --all               # Include evidence + extractions
vhir backup --verify /path/to/backup/INC-2026-0225/  # Verify backup integrity
```

The LLM can also create case-data-only backups at investigation checkpoints — it uses the `backup_case` tool on case-mcp.

## Evidence Indexing with OpenSearch

When opensearch-mcp is installed, evidence is parsed programmatically and indexed into OpenSearch, giving the LLM 17 purpose-built query tools instead of consuming billions of tokens reading raw artifacts.

### Ingesting Evidence

Full triage package (auto-discovers hosts and artifact types):

```bash
opensearch-ingest scan /path/to/kape/output --hostname SERVER01 --case incident-001
```

Memory image:

```bash
opensearch-ingest memory /path/to/memory.raw --hostname DC01 --case incident-001
```

Generic formats:

```bash
opensearch-ingest json /path/to/suricata/eve.json --hostname FW01 --case incident-001
opensearch-ingest delimited /path/to/zeek/logs/ --hostname SENSOR01 --case incident-001
opensearch-ingest accesslog /path/to/apache/access.log --hostname WEB01 --case incident-001
```

Or ask the LLM to ingest evidence — it uses the ingest tools on opensearch-mcp. Just tell it what evidence to ingest and from which host.

### 15 Parsers

15 parser modules handle the forensic evidence spectrum. The table below groups related parsers — W3C covers IIS, HTTPERR, and Windows Firewall as separate parse paths; Prefetch and SRUM each have their own module.

| Parser | Artifacts | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| evtx | Windows Event Logs | pyevtx-rs (ECS-normalized) |
| EZ Tools (10) | Shimcache, Amcache, MFT, USN, Registry, Shellbags, Jumplists, LNK, Recyclebin, Timeline | Eric Zimmerman tools via wintools-mcp |
| Volatility 3 | Memory forensics (26 plugins, 3 tiers) | vol3 subprocess |
| JSON/JSONL | Suricata EVE, tshark, Velociraptor, any JSON | Auto-detect format |
| Delimited | CSV, TSV, Zeek TSV, bodyfile, L2T supertimelines | Auto-detect delimiter |
| Access logs | Apache/Nginx combined/common format | Regex parser |
| W3C | IIS, HTTPERR, Windows Firewall | W3C Extended Log Format |
| Defender | Windows Defender MPLog | Pattern extraction |
| Tasks | Windows Scheduled Tasks XML | defusedxml |
| WER | Windows Error Reporting | Crash report parser |
| SSH | OpenSSH auth logs | Regex with timezone handling |
| Transcripts | PowerShell transcripts | Header + command extraction |
| Prefetch/SRUM | Execution + network usage | Plaso or wintools |

Every parser produces deterministic content-based document IDs (re-ingest = zero duplicates), full provenance (`host.name`, `vhir.source_file`, `vhir.ingest_audit_id`, `vhir.parse_method`, `pipeline_version`), and proper `@timestamp` with timezone handling.

### Hayabusa Auto-Detection

After EVTX ingest, opensearch-mcp checks if Hayabusa is installed and automatically runs it against the event logs. Hayabusa applies 3,700+ Sigma-based detection rules and indexes the alerts into `case-*-hayabusa-*` indices. Ask the LLM to list detections or search for critical/high alerts.

### Querying Indexed Evidence

The LLM queries indexed evidence through opensearch-mcp's 8 query tools. Start by asking for a case overview, then direct the LLM to search, aggregate, or build timelines:

- **"Give me a case summary"** — the LLM calls `idx_case_summary` to show hosts, artifact types, document counts, and enrichment status
- **"Show me all 4688 events where cmd.exe was spawned from an unusual parent"** — structured search across event logs
- **"What are the top 20 processes flagged as suspicious?"** — aggregation by field with triage verdict filter
- **"Show me a timeline of all malicious threat intel hits by hour"** — date histogram for temporal analysis
- **"What unique source IPs appear in the event logs?"** — field value enumeration
- **"How many logon events are there?"** — fast document counts

All indices follow the naming convention: `case-{case_id}-{artifact_type}-{hostname}`. The LLM can query across an entire case or target specific artifact types and hosts. See the [MCP Reference](mcp-reference.md#opensearch-mcp-17-tools) for the full list of query tools and parameters.

### Programmatic Enrichment

Two post-ingest enrichment pipelines add context without consuming LLM tokens:

**Triage baseline** (`idx_enrich_triage`): Checks indexed filenames and services against the Windows baseline database (via windows-triage-mcp). Stamps documents with `triage.verdict` (EXPECTED, SUSPICIOUS, UNKNOWN, EXPECTED_LOLBIN). Includes 14 registry persistence detection rules (IFEO, Winlogon, LSA, Print Monitors, etc.) that run as direct OpenSearch queries.

**Threat intelligence** (`idx_enrich_intel`): Extracts unique external IPs, hashes, and domains from indexed data, looks them up in OpenCTI, and stamps matching documents with `threat_intel.verdict` and confidence. 200 unique IOCs checked in ~10 seconds vs. 100K inline lookups that would take 83 minutes.

Both enrichments are programmatic — zero LLM tokens consumed. After enrichment, ask the LLM to search for suspicious or malicious verdicts, or aggregate by triage verdict to see the distribution.


## Deep Analysis with Forensic Tools

### SIFT Tools (via sift-mcp)

sift-mcp provides `run_command()` for executing any forensic tool installed on the SIFT workstation. A denylist blocks destructive binaries (mkfs, shutdown, kill, nc/ncat). All other tools can execute. Cataloged tools get enriched responses with forensic-knowledge data (caveats, corroboration suggestions, field meanings); uncataloged tools get basic response envelopes.

Examples of what you can ask the LLM:

```
"Ingest all evidence from /cases/evidence/ into OpenSearch and give me a summary of the artifacts ingested"
"Show me all 4688 events where cmd.exe spawned from an unusual parent process"
"Aggregate the top 20 source IPs across all hosts and check them against threat intel"
"Run triage enrichment and show me anything flagged as suspicious"
"Parse the Amcache hive from workstation3"
"See if this registry value exists on any of the other hosts in OpenSearch"
"What tools should I use to investigate lateral movement artifacts?"
"Run hayabusa against the evtx logs and show critical/high alerts"
"Extract the $MFT and build a filesystem timeline"
"Analyze this memory dump with Volatility — list processes and network connections"
"Check if svchost.exe with parent wsmprovhost.exe is normal"
"Look up this hash in threat intel"
"Upload this binary to REMnux and analyze it"
```

### Windows Tools (via wintools-mcp)

wintools-mcp runs on a separate Windows workstation and provides catalog-gated tool execution. Only tools defined in YAML catalog files can run. 31 cataloged tools across 7 categories: Zimmerman suite (14), Sysinternals (5), memory analysis (4), timeline (3), malware analysis (3), collection (1), and scripts (1).

Additional capabilities:
- `batch_scan` — run a tool against all files in a directory with safety bounds
- `list_kape_targets` — list KAPE targets/modules for evidence parsing
- `get_share_info` — get SMB share paths for evidence access

**Evidence access:** Valhuntir configures an authenticated SMB share from the Windows workstation to the case directory on SIFT. This allows wintools-mcp to read evidence files, write parsed output to the extractions directory, and record audit trail entries — all without manually copying files between systems. The gateway proxies tool calls to wintools-mcp over HTTPS with Bearer token authentication. See the [Deployment Guide](deployment.md) for SMB setup and firewall configuration, or the [wintools-mcp README](https://github.com/AppliedIR/wintools-mcp) for detailed configuration.

### Tool Discovery

Both sift-mcp and wintools-mcp provide discovery tools. Ask the LLM:

- **"What forensic tools are installed?"** — lists available tools on SIFT or Windows
- **"What tools should I use for lateral movement artifacts?"** — suggests relevant tools with corroboration guidance
- **"How do I use AmcacheParser?"** — returns usage info, flags, caveats, and interpretation guidance

## Cross-Reference and Validation

### Forensic Knowledge RAG (forensic-rag-mcp)

Semantic search across 22,000+ records from 23 authoritative sources:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sigma` | SigmaHQ Detection Rules |
| `atomic` | Atomic Red Team Tests |
| `mitre_attack` | MITRE ATT&CK Framework |
| `mitre_car` | MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository |
| `mitre_d3fend` | MITRE D3FEND Defensive Techniques |
| `mitre_atlas` | MITRE ATLAS AI/ML Attack Framework |
| `mitre_engage` | MITRE Engage Adversary Engagement |
| `capec` | MITRE CAPEC Attack Patterns |
| `mbc` | MITRE MBC Malware Behavior Catalog |
| `cisa_kev` | CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities |
| `elastic` | Elastic Detection Rules |
| `splunk_security` | Splunk Security Content |
| `lolbas` | LOLBAS Project |
| `gtfobins` | GTFOBins |
| `loldrivers` | LOLDrivers Vulnerable Driver Database |
| `hijacklibs` | HijackLibs DLL Hijacking Database |
| `forensic_artifacts` | ForensicArtifacts Definitions |
| `kape` | KAPE Targets & Modules |
| `velociraptor` | Velociraptor Artifact Exchange |
| `stratus_red_team` | Stratus Red Team Cloud Attacks |
| `chainsaw` | Chainsaw Detection Rules (EVTX + MFT) |
| `hayabusa` | Hayabusa Built-in Detection Rules |
| `forensic_clarifications` | Authoritative Forensic Artifact Clarifications |

Ask the LLM to search for detection rules, MITRE techniques, forensic artifacts, or any security topic. It can filter by source (e.g., Sigma rules only) and platform (Windows/Linux). Results are ranked by relevance — the LLM uses this to ground its analysis in authoritative references rather than training data.

### Windows Baseline Validation (windows-triage-mcp)

Offline validation against 2.6 million known Windows file and process baseline records. No network calls required.

Ask the LLM to check files, processes, services, scheduled tasks, registry entries, hashes, DLLs, named pipes, or filenames against the baseline. For example: "Is svchost.exe with parent cmd.exe normal?" or "Check if this hash is a known vulnerable driver."

Verdicts:
- **EXPECTED** — in the Windows baseline
- **EXPECTED_LOLBIN** — baseline match with LOLBin capability (legitimate but abusable)
- **SUSPICIOUS** — anomaly detected (wrong path, Unicode homoglyphs, known C2 pipe, vulnerable driver)
- **UNKNOWN** — not in the database (neutral, not an indicator — most third-party software returns this)

### Threat Intelligence (opencti-mcp)

Live threat intelligence from your configured OpenCTI instance. Ask the LLM to look up IOCs, search for threat actors or malware families, check recent indicators, map entity relationships, or search threat reports. For example: "Look up this IP in threat intel" or "What malware is associated with APT29?"

### Malware Analysis (remnux-mcp)

When connected to a REMnux VM, ask the LLM to upload and analyze suspicious files. For example: "Upload this binary to REMnux and analyze it" or "Extract IOCs from the suspect executable." Analysis depth tiers: `quick` (initial triage), `standard` (default), `deep` (known-malicious or evasive).

## Recording Findings

Findings are the core output of an investigation. Each finding represents something significant enough to appear in the final IR report.

### What Qualifies as a Finding

- A suspicious artifact, anomaly, or IOC with supporting evidence
- A benign exclusion (ruling something out, with evidence why)
- A causal link between events
- A significant evidence gap that affects conclusions

Routine tool output is NOT a finding. "Ran AmcacheParser, got 42 entries" goes in the audit trail. "AmcacheParser shows Mimikatz installation at 14:32 UTC, no corresponding Prefetch entry" is a finding.

### How Findings Are Created

The intended flow:

1. LLM analyzes tool output
2. LLM presents evidence to the examiner with the actual log entry/record (not a summary)
3. Examiner gives conversational approval
4. LLM calls `record_finding()` with evidence artifacts and provenance

### Finding Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | Brief summary of the finding |
| `observation` | Yes | What was seen (factual — the evidence itself) |
| `interpretation` | Yes | What it might mean (analytical) |
| `confidence` | Yes | HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or SPECULATIVE |
| `confidence_justification` | Yes | Why this confidence level |
| `type` | Yes | finding, conclusion, attribution, or exclusion |
| `audit_ids` | Yes | References to MCP tool execution evidence IDs |
| `event_timestamp` | Recommended | When the incident event occurred (ISO 8601, from the evidence) |
| `host` | Recommended | Which system is affected |
| `affected_account` | Recommended | Which user/service account |
| `mitre_ids` | Optional | MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs |
| `iocs` | Optional | Indicators of compromise |
| `tags` | Optional | Searchable labels |
| `artifacts` | Recommended | Evidence artifacts (see below) |
| `supporting_commands` | Optional | Shell commands used (for SHELL provenance tier) |

### Evidence Artifacts

Findings should include an `artifacts` list showing the actual evidence. Each artifact contains the source file, the tool command that processed it, and the raw output — not a summary. The `audit_id` from the tool response ties the artifact to a specific entry in the audit trail, and the `source` file must be registered in the evidence registry.

Findings without artifacts — such as analytical conclusions or exclusions — can use `supporting_commands` instead.

Example:

```json
{
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "source": "/cases/evidence/Security.evtx",
      "extraction": "EvtxECmd -f Security.evtx --csv /tmp/out",
      "content": "2026-01-24 15:00:41,4688,SERVER01\\admin,cmd.exe,...",
      "content_type": "csv_row",
      "audit_id": "sift-steve-20260124-042"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Provenance Enforcement

When a finding is recorded, `record_finding()` classifies its provenance by scanning the audit trail for each `audit_id` referenced by the finding:

| Tier | Where the audit_id was found | Trust Level |
|------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **MCP** | MCP backend audit log | System-witnessed (highest) |
| **HOOK** | Claude Code hook log (`claude-code.jsonl`) | Framework-witnessed |
| **SHELL** | Not in audit trail — provided via `supporting_commands` | Self-reported |
| **NONE** | Not found anywhere | **Rejected** by hard gate |

The finding is stamped with its provenance tier. Findings with NONE provenance and no supporting commands are automatically rejected.

The **Evidence Provenance Chain** — visible in the Examiner Portal on each finding — traces the full path from finding back to registered evidence: which evidence file was input, which tool processed it, and what output was extracted. This lets the examiner verify any claim back to its source.

### Grounding Score

When a finding is staged, forensic-mcp checks whether the investigation consulted authoritative reference sources (forensic-rag, windows-triage, opencti). Findings are scored STRONG (2+ sources), PARTIAL (1 source or evidence chain to registered files), or WEAK (none). The score is advisory — it nudges the LLM to cross-reference but does not block the finding.

### IOC Auto-Extraction

When findings include IOCs (IPs, hashes, domains, URLs), they are automatically extracted to `iocs.json` with category and status tracking. IOC approval cascades from the parent finding — when all source findings reach the same status, the IOC follows.

## Timeline

Timeline events represent key moments in the incident narrative — timestamps that would appear in a timeline report. Not every timestamp in the evidence is a timeline event; MFT entries showing normal system activity are data, while the timestamp when a malicious process first executed is a timeline event.

### Recording Timeline Events

The LLM records timeline events through forensic-mcp when it discovers significant timestamps during analysis. Each event includes the timestamp, description, source artifact, event type, and links to related findings.

Event types: `process`, `network`, `file`, `registry`, `auth`, `persistence`, `lateral`, `execution`, `other`.

### Filtering Timeline

```bash
vhir review --timeline                           # All timeline events
vhir review --timeline --status APPROVED          # Approved only
vhir review --timeline --type lateral             # By event type
vhir review --timeline --start 2026-01-20T00:00 --end 2026-01-22T23:59
```

The LLM can also filter the timeline using the `get_timeline` tool on forensic-mcp, with the same status, event type, and date range filters.

## Review and Approval

All findings and timeline events stage as DRAFT. Only a human examiner can approve or reject them — the AI cannot bypass the approval mechanism. The Examiner Portal is the preferred review interface. The vhir CLI provides the same capability from the terminal.

### Examiner Portal

The Examiner Portal is the primary review interface. Open it:

```bash
vhir portal
```

The portal has 8 tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Overview** | Investigation progress, getting started guide |
| **Findings** | Core review workflow with provenance chain display |
| **Timeline** | Chronological events with color-coded ruler |
| **Hosts** | Systems involved (aggregated from findings) |
| **Accounts** | User/service accounts (aggregated from findings) |
| **Evidence** | Registered files with SHA-256 integrity verification |
| **IOCs** | Indicators extracted from findings with category/status filters |
| **TODOs** | Outstanding investigation tasks |

Examiners can edit finding fields inline (confidence, justification, observation, interpretation, MITRE IDs, IOCs, tags), approve or reject items, and commit decisions — all in the browser.

Keyboard shortcuts: `1`-`8` switch tabs, `j`/`k` navigate items, `a` approve, `r` reject, `e` edit, `Shift+C` commit.

The Commit button (`Shift+C`) requires the examiner's password — the password never leaves the browser.

### CLI Approval

```bash
vhir approve                                    # Interactive review
vhir approve F-steve-001 F-steve-002            # Approve specific findings
vhir approve F-steve-003 --note "Confirmed"     # With examiner note
vhir approve F-steve-004 --edit                 # Edit in $EDITOR first
vhir approve --findings-only                    # Review only findings
vhir approve --timeline-only                    # Review only timeline
vhir approve --review                           # Apply pending portal edits
```

### Rejecting Findings

```bash
vhir reject F-steve-004 --reason "Insufficient evidence, timestamp inconsistency"
```

### Reviewing Case Status

```bash
vhir review                              # Case summary
vhir review --findings                   # Findings table
vhir review --findings --detail          # Full finding details
vhir review --findings --status DRAFT    # Filter by status
vhir review --timeline                   # Timeline events
vhir review --todos --open               # Open TODOs
vhir review --evidence                   # Evidence integrity
vhir review --iocs                       # IOCs from findings
vhir review --audit                      # Audit trail
```

The LLM can retrieve findings, timeline events, TODOs, case status, and audit data through forensic-mcp and case-mcp. The Examiner Portal also displays all of this in the browser. The CLI is one option, not a requirement.

### Integrity Verification

```bash
vhir review --verify                # Full verification (all examiners)
vhir review --verify --mine         # Current examiner only
```

This performs three levels of verification:
- **Content hash check**: SHA-256 hashes in `findings.json` vs. `approvals.jsonl`
- **Ledger reconciliation**: Cross-checks approved items against the HMAC verification ledger
- **HMAC verification**: Recomputes HMAC-SHA256 signatures using the examiner's password

## Report Generation

Reports are generated through report-mcp (via the LLM) or the vhir CLI. Only APPROVED findings appear in reports.

### Report Profiles

| Profile | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `full` | Comprehensive IR report with all approved data |
| `executive` | Management briefing (1-2 pages, non-technical) |
| `timeline` | Chronological event narrative |
| `ioc` | Structured IOC export with MITRE mapping |
| `findings` | Detailed approved findings |
| `status` | Quick status for standups |

### Via LLM

Ask the LLM:

```
"Generate a full incident response report"
"Create an executive summary for management"
"Generate an IOC report with MITRE mappings"
```

The LLM calls `generate_report()` which returns structured case data, IOC aggregation, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and Zeltser IR Writing guidance. The LLM then renders narrative sections following Zeltser's IR templates and the guidance from the [Zeltser IR Writing MCP](https://website-mcp.zeltser.com/mcp).

### Via CLI

```bash
vhir report --full --save full-report.json
vhir report --executive-summary
vhir report --ioc
vhir report --status-brief
vhir report --timeline --from 2026-01-20 --to 2026-01-22
vhir report --findings F-steve-001,F-steve-002
```

### Setting Case Metadata

Report metadata is stored in CASE.yaml and appears in generated reports. Ask the LLM to set metadata — it uses the `set_case_metadata` tool on report-mcp. For example: "Set the incident type to ransomware and severity to critical."

## Investigation TODOs

Track what still needs to be done:

```bash
vhir todo add "Analyze USB device history" --priority high --finding F-steve-002
vhir todo add "Cross-reference DNS logs" --assignee bob
vhir review --todos --open
vhir todo complete TODO-steve-001
```

The LLM can also manage TODOs through forensic-mcp. The CLI is not required.

## Collaboration (Multi-Examiner)

Each examiner works on their own SIFT workstation with a local case directory. Collaboration uses export/merge:

### Export

```bash
vhir export --file findings-alice.json
vhir export --file recent-alice.json --since 2026-01-24T00:00
```

### Merge

```bash
vhir merge --file findings-bob.json
```

Merge uses last-write-wins by `modified_at` timestamp. APPROVED findings are protected from overwrite. IDs include the examiner name (e.g., `F-alice-001`, `F-bob-003`) so they never collide across examiners.

The LLM can export and import bundles through case-mcp. The CLI is not required.

## Audit Trail

Every MCP tool call is logged to a per-backend JSONL file in the case `audit/` directory with a unique evidence ID (`{backend}-{examiner}-{YYYYMMDD}-{NNN}`).

```bash
vhir audit log                       # Recent audit entries
vhir audit log --mcp forensic-mcp    # Filter by backend
vhir audit log --tool run_command    # Filter by tool
vhir audit summary                   # Counts per MCP and tool
```

When Claude Code is the LLM client, a PostToolUse hook additionally captures every Bash command to `audit/claude-code.jsonl`.

The LLM can also write to the audit trail:
- `log_reasoning()` — record analytical decisions at decision points (no approval needed)
- `log_external_action()` — record non-MCP tool execution
- `record_action()` — record investigative actions
